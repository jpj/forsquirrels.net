    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>
      If there is a problem with the site
      or anything like that, feel free to contact me to let me know. Or
      if you just want to say "Hey" or if you want to say, "I see that
      you  like For Squirrels. So do I. Hi." then that is fine too. My
      email is &lt;<i>joshj <span style="font-weight: bold;">at</span>
      solairis <span style="font-weight: bold;">dot</span> net</i>&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bear in mind, this will just get you in touch with
      the guy that
      made this website. It will not get you any closer to contacting
      the remaining memers of For Squirrels/Subrosa/Artichoke/etc.
      You're on your own with that one.

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      This website is merely a fan site for the band.
      I am not affiliated with them in any way, but I do like their music
      and I do like to make websites. This seemed like the next
      logical step.
    </p>

    <h2 id="disclaimer">Legal Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>
      Every website has a legal disclaimer of some sort. I was starting
      to feel left out.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">
      All music and lyrics on this site are by For Squirrels and Subrosa.  None
      of the lyrics or music was given to me by the band, it all reflects the
      interpretation of the individual.
