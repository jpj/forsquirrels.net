    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>
      If there is a problem with the site
      or anything like that, feel free to contact me to let me know. Or
      if you just want to say "Hey" or if you want to say, "I see that
      you  like For Squirrels. So do I. Hi." then that is fine too. My
      email is &lt;<i>joshj <span style="font-weight: bold;">at</span>
      solairis <span style="font-weight: bold;">dot</span> net</i>&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bear in mind, this will just get you in touch with
      the guy that
      made this website. It will not get you any closer to contacting
      the remaining memers of For Squirrels/Subrosa/Artichoke/etc.
      You're on your own with that one.
