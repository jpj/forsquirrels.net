    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>
      If there is a problem with the site
      or anything like that, feel free to contact me to let me know. Or
      if you just want to say "Hey" or if you want to say, "I see that
      you  like For Squirrels. So do I. Hi." then that is fine too. My
      email is &lt;<i>joshj <span style="font-weight: bold;">at</span>
      forsquirrels <span style="font-weight: bold;">dot</span> net</i>&gt;. You will notice that
      it is spelled out instead of using cool characters and also that it
      is not a link. With spam running rampant the way it is nowadays
      I try to protect myself the best I can. You will have to decipher
      the italicized text the best you can if you really want to email
      me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bear in mind, this will just get you in touch with
      <a href="http://www.solairis.com/~josh/">the guy</a> that
      made this website. It will not get you any closer to contacting
      the remaining memers of For Squirrels/Subrosa/Artichoke/etc.
      You're on your own with that one.
