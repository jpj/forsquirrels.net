well this is a job for the northern army union
Where the boy before has lost his [former?] reason
Well I hold it high so people can see me
But [?...?] all the tiny muscles

I'm the flagboy now
I'm the flagboy now
I'm the flagboy now oh now

[?...?]breath is weak and my eyes are getting older
But the war rages on

I'm the flagboy now oh now

Make your momma proud
Oh the body of the flagboy has been found
Make your momma proud
Oh the body of the flagboy has been found

Take me back to Hampton and the city
Oh where the air is clear and the girls are all so pretty
Well I miss my dog but most of all I miss my best friend Nick
How can I go on

I'm the flagboy now

Where the boy before has lost his war to reason
Well I hold it high so evil Lee can see me
oh right there Sir, yes I'm sure of the tiny muscles

I'm the flagboy now
I'm the flagboy now

temps are starved my breath is weak and my eyes are getting older
But the war rages on
The men are cramped I'm bleeding sand but oh the slavemaid suffers 
The war rages on

I'm the flagboy now oh now

Make your mama proud

words according to the perception of Kevin M Walsh &lt;k_man61@hotmail.com&gt;
words in ( ) indicate backing vocals

Leaves are more beautiful than the water overseen
Her body looming architecture
Nothing to gage nothing to read or go by
Oh I will have you I will win

Every tread can be worn down from every sole
Oh every tread cannot be me

She will remain lost in his young and open eyes
She will remain never to be found again
Ripped to the ground dropped with a thud the sky is spinning
Stand high above him scream as loud as you can you can

I've seen it all before
Oh concrete meets the floor
Ask me if I care I will follow you I will follow you

I've seen it all before
  (Oh...
Oh concrete meets the floor
  ...oh
Oh ask me if I care I will follow you I will follow you

There's nothing in my eyes nothing to look for
Sealed your fate you've sealed your fate
I am standing cold and in the dark days
The light's been seeping through your door

Every tread can be worn down from every sole
Every tread cannot be me

I've seen it all before
Oh concrete meets the floor
Ask me if I care I will follow you I will follow you

I've seen it all before

This is what I can hear of lyrics for Go On Up, I have only found one other
version of the lyrics and they don't sound right at all.  Some of these
lyrics I cannot distinguish, and will be marked by "[lyrics?]"... maybe someone
else can use this to actually figure out what is being said.

GO ON UP
I've got fourteen million years until my head falls down
with a bigger guy standing in my shoulder
ask me how I got there [but I, how I got here and there but uh?]
who's that man?
 
Forty years to pass him,
I don't want to, can I [kick or skip?] the rut and ride ride ride?
Ask me how big of a rifleman, there's got to be ["to be a" or "a bigger"] survivor
I can feel you out there,
but I can't feel you

I've got [acrobats, and &lt;undecipherable&gt;] and like a beggar I can be as lonesome as a dove.
Automatic, retroactive [piece of berlin, mint &lt;undecipherable&gt;]
Answer me no questions because [I can, I can, I can I feed my squirrel please?]
Ask me how big of a rifleman, there's got to be ["to be a" or "a bigger"] survivor
Well I can feel you out there,
but I can't see you at all.
 
["Wrap me up and" or "for any other band"] that will be fine
Wrap me up and I'll do it all the time
Oh ["Wrap me up and" or "for any other band"] that will be fine
Oh wrap me up because I do it all the time..
 
Something in my head keeps saying "Go on up, and go on up, and go, let's go!"
Little [kids they say that?] they say "Go on up, and go on up, and go, let's go!"
"Refuse to be the [backseat or patsy?] of your operation, go on up, and go, let's go!"
Ask me how big of a genius man there's got to be before he [believes or bleeds?] us
I can feel you out there,
but I can't see you at all.

["Wrap me up and" or "for any other band"] that will be fine
Oh Wrap me up because I'll do it all the time
Oh ["Wrap me up and" or "for any other band"] that will be fine
Oh wrap me up and I do it all the time..

I can't see the hand before my face, I just want to see the light of day.
I saw [the redcoats, I saw ?] anyone and everyone.
I saw [the redcoats off of ?] anyone and everyone.</pre>

Paddle him more beat him till he sees
(Hey you we'll find a way)
Paddle him more make him a man
Paddle him more that doesn't change
(Hey you we'll find a way)
The fact that he is just a little
Paddle him more beat him till he sees
(To find something to say)
Paddle him more that he should be thankful
Paddle him more make sure he speaks
(To find a way)
Only when he is spoken to

Kill the Birds
And feed them their honor
Cause we all know that we die

You'd never think behind his broken smile
(Hey you we'll find a way)
He had the power had the strenght you'd never think behind the weakness was
(Hey you we'll find a way)
A hollow spot you can dress him up a hollow spot you can part his hair
(Did you find something to say)
a hollow spot you can load him in the car and you can drive him there
(Did you find something to say)

Kill the Birds
And feed them their honor
Cause we all know that we die
Kill the Birds
And feed them their honor
Cause we all know that we die

Now take your hands and place them on your head
(Hey you we'll find a way)
I do not know what it is before me I do not know what it is you want me to be
(Hey you we'll find a way)
You try and you try but I don't understand You try and you try but I'll never
comprehend
(Did you find something to say)
You try and you try but you can't change me it's me it's me it's me
(Will you find something to say)

Kill the Birds
And feed them their honor
Cause we all know that we die
Kill the Birds
And feed them their honor
Cause we all know that we die

I will be
Here's the end</pre>

I cannot fail to remember,
The eyes melt, then small tears
A new life, a new existence
I was so enthralled by these
Rolled up in a new body
You alone, change each life
My sister's such infectious little memories

Take it from me
Don't be afraid of who you are
Well take it from me
Be weary of the things you see
We're all fine

Knew you before you knew me
Your favorite things, unacceptable things
Cloth diapers and teething rings
Come crank my swing cause I can't sleep
Fold up in a tiny town,
It's a pretty picture of perfection
My sister's such infectious little memories

Take it from me
Don't be afraid of who you are
Take it from me
Be weary of the things you see
Take it from me
What can be spared does not belong
Take it from me

And we're all fine
Beautiful red robin, beautiful
Beautiful red robin, beautiful

Recognize means so softly a china doll with eyes that see
Laughter that can warm the room, most like momma's things we sing
Grown up well(?) before your grown, I relate to you and you to me
My sister's such infectious little memories

Take it from me
Don't be afraid of who you are
Take it from me
Be weary of the things you see
Take it from me
What can be spared does not belong
Take it from me

And we're all fine, with everything
Beautiful red robin, beautiful
Beautiful red robin, beautiful
Beautiful red robin, beautiful
Beautiful red robin, beautiful</pre>

Hello out there I want you to know
I'm here all alone
No tears no laugh no protection from
The bird beginning to grow
The bird beginning to grow

Hello out there I want you to know
One pillow in my bed
Two rooms three chairs one spoon and a bowl
The bird beginning to grow
The bird beginning to grow

Hello out there I want you to know
My shell [Michelle?] lay on the floor
Five bullets six holes four lips and they're cold
And chill
chill

Don't know if I'm gonna rot tonight
Don't know if I'm gonna fall too far
Don't know if I'll ever be
Anyone at all
Don't know if I'm gonna rot tonight
Don't know if I'm gonna fall too far
Don't know if I'll ever be
Anyone at all

Please don't take that from me
It's mine not yours it's so hard to see
Please don't take that from me
It's mine not yours it's so hard to see

Hello out there I want you to know
You are not alone
He gave you breath he'll give you a life
Eternally
Eternally

Don't know if I'm gonna rot tonight
Don't know if I'm gonna fall too far
Don't know if I'll ever be
Anyone at all
Don't know if I'm gonna rot tonight
Don't know if I'm gonna fall too far
Don't know if I'll ever be
Anyone at all

Please don't take that from me
It's mine not yours it's so hard to see
Please don't take that from me
It's mine not yours it's so hard to see

And if you go if you go if you go your own way
You will be you will be alone the whole way
If you go if you go if you go your own way
There's always time always time for the last line</pre>

 so i hide behind my picket fence
 a triangle it not structurally sound
 and at any time it could crumble to the ground
 ? it seems so grand but some day i swear it'll crumble into sand
 it seems that you live your life in threes
 its rays over my head like a sword of ??? i refuse

I used the lyrics on your site, and my own stuff. This is what I came up 
with:

3 is the number of guilt
Guilt is the house that Triad built

I fear the triad consequence(?)
So I hide behind my picket fence

A triangle is not structurally sound
At any time it could crumble to the ground
Still bet your butt that is seems so grand
Yeah, but someday I swear it'll crumble into sand

It seems that you live your life in 3s
It's raised over my head head like the sword of Demicles
I refuse just a corner of the stone
If the choice is 3 or 1 then I'd rather be alone

A triangle is not structurally sound
At any time it may crumble to the ground
Still bet your butt that is seems so grand
Yeah, but someday I swear it'll crumble...(x2)
Into sand...

Into sand...
Into sand...

So good-bye Baypath road all your influence is done
Cause now I live by hope, you see, I'm waiting for the one
So when you think of yesterday, remember 3
When you decide on 2, remember me...


I hope it makes sense.
