Will she ever go
Will she ever show
Could it be the sound of the engine
Do I hear the sound of the door slam
Is it me or am I dreaming

I just want to hold the sun
I just want my day to come
I really need this one

Gone and forgot
Gone but not forgotten
Do I hear the sound of the plane crash
Do I hear the sound of the clock turn
Is it me or am I dreaming

I just want to hold the sun
I just want my day to come
I really need this one

Will she ever go
Will she ever show
Could it be the sound of the engine
Do I hear the sound of the door slam
Is it me or am I dreaming

I just want to hold the sun
I just want my day to come

Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go

I'd like to go
I'd like to go
I'd like to go home</pre>

The farmer digs a hole and fills it in with boiling oil
Hoping to make a dress and from the ground to make it well
Say Orangeworker are you tried and true
Say Orangeworker can you see it through

Lie don't fly Orangeworker are you tried and true
Fly don't fly Orangeworker can you see it through

The farmer digs a hole and fills it in with boiling oil
Someday he'll clear the rest and fog and pond deliverance
Say Orangeworker are you tried and true
Say Orangeworker can you see it through

She lies in a bedpan with her name scrawled on her back
It sure sounds funny when you say his name like that
He lies in an empty room with his hair burnt to the back
It sure sounds funny when you say his name like that

Ship me off to the morgue I'm ready to be buried alone way down in my bed
And I'm alone without the sun
Send me off to the morgue I'm ready to be buried away down in my bed
And I'm alone without the sun
Please just take one

And by the grace of god go I into the great unknown
Thing are gonna change in our favor
And if we gather, if we fall over the great unknown
Things are gonna change in our favor

100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 Oh they're found dead, dead
And I am numb from watching TV
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 Oh they're just there, there
And I am numb from Watching TV
Please don't break me

And by the grace of god go I into the great unknown
Things are gonna change in our favor
And if we gather, if we fall over the great unknown
Things are gonna change in our favor

(Instrumental break)

Please just take one....

And by the grace of god go I into the great unknown
Things are gonna change in our favor
And if we gather, if we fall over the great unknown
Thing are gonna change in our favor</pre>

In my room on a pad
Was written a letter return address to you
Oh I had walked over a mile
And under a stone wall across the fields of snow 

And I've been feeling so grand oh no,
Tell me now who do you think I am

Arrived there tired and cold
Delivered your letter return address to you
This is the house this is the road
And here's my letter where the heck are you

And I've been feeling so... oh no,
Tell me now who do you think I am

Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury me
Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury 

In my room on the fire
Was burning a letter return address to you
Oh I had walked over a mile
And under a stone wall where the heck were you 

And I've been feeling so grand oh no,
Tell me now who do you think I am... It's just that
It's a little bit harder just to hold your hand, around, around, around we go
Tell me now who do you think I am

Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury me
Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury me

And I've been feeling so grand oh no,
Tell me now who do you think I am... It's just that
It's a little bit harder just to hold your hand, around, around, around we go
Tell me now who do you think I am

In my room I'm so shocking
In my room I'm so very very shocking shocking shocking

Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury me
Lay down under the play ground hold up, I can't hold up for long
Lay down under the play ground please don't bury me
please don't bury me, bury me, bury me all these lies</pre>

Say what you're gonna say and do what you're gonna do
I can't believe what's got into you
The day is long and the night is quick the dying young, the poor, the rich 
I am poor I am poor I am poor

Say what you're gonna say and do what you're gonna do

I'm leaving before you, giving the cue and I am 
I'm leaving before you, under all this pain this beauty
I'm leaving before you, everybody everybody wants to be in my band, my band

I am dog and pony, I am finding out about you
Dog and a pony, has it come and gone so quickly
The dog and the pony, come on, come on tell me I am grand, I am

Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone

I'm cut for the last time, you have paid me for my patience
Cut for the last time, the scar tissue has grown over
I'm cut for the last time, come on come on tell me I am grand I am

Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone you're gone, you're gone you're
Gone

Ya da da da da da you're
Gone you can't stop the pain from fleeing
Gone you can't pick the kingdoms' dreaming
Gone you can't kill the pain I'm feeling
Gone You're
Gone You're 
Gone You're 
Gone you're gone you're gone you're
Gone</pre>

Nietzche's dead the poet wrong
I stumbled on my pretty song
Run from me run from the shame
I cannot help it anyway
The sun is strong the sun is strong
The truth be told I am alone
I am alone
I am alone
I am alone

Garden queen with the common touch
Struggled tear, I've asked too much
Oh I can barely breathe
I can barely see
Every single action I'll be I'll be death defy
Death defy
Death defy
Death defy

It's all just a game
It's all just a game

It's all yours
It's all yours
It's all yours
It's all yours
Please don't give it up now
Please don't give it up now
Please don't give it up now
Please don't don't give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up

It's all just a game
It's all just a game

I am alone
I am alone
Death defy
Death defy
Whom I ever lovin
Whom I ever lovin
Whom I ever lovin

Quiet little boy hand in her pocket
There's no reason for the sun today
All is quiet and I still can remember
Are we growing old

After all of the set-ups and let-downs
After all of your cities in bags 
Will we ever drink milk from a fountain
Will we ever be there

Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all
Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all

I believe that she's out wearing hit parade
I believe that she's out of her mind
Try and picture your hand on her trigger
Try and picture the gun

Time is wasting she answers quite dreary
Tide is turning the undertowed strong
Please believe me I'm telling a tall tale
Dream weaver comes clean

Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all
Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all
Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need I don't need I don't need no
much at all at all...

Everybody had a great bit of funny
Everybody will beg her to stay
Eyes return her to dreams of the union
Her eyes scream to me

After all of your set-ups and let downs
After all of your cities in bags 
Will we ever drink milk from a fountain
Will she ever feel

I will never bow to the ages
I will never let down my guard
Ask for nothing and you get what you paid for
I've got pride instead

Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all
Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need much at all
Hey, hey, I don't mind I don't need I don't need I don't need no
much at all at all...</pre>

Paint me something beautiful
Eskimo sandune
One day sometime suitable
I'll trade this fools gold

Am I enough enough please
Am I enough enough please

We'll go no one has to know
Behind the sandune
There I'll tell you anything 
On pins and needles
You wait you want everything
Even this fools gold
Come close tightly close your eyes
I know the sand blows

Am I enough enough please
Am I enough enough please
Cold New England morning brings with it a warning
Am I meant to be alone
Cold New England morning brings with it a warning
Clouds upon a dying sun

We'll go no one has to know
Behind the sandune
There I'll tell you anything 
On pins and needles
Come close tightly close your eyes
I know the sand blows</pre>
