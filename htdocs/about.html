      This website is merely a fan site for the band.
      <a href="http://www.solairis.com/~josh/">I</a>
      am not affiliated with them in any way, but I do like their music
      and I do like to make websites. This seemed like the next
      logical step.

    <p>
      Every website has a legal disclaimer of some sort. I was starting
      to feel left out.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">
      All music and lyrics on this site are by For Squirrels and Subrosa.  None
      of the lyrics or music was given to me by the band, it all reflects the
      interpretation of the individual.
