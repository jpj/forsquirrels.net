I don't know if there are any standard ways of making tablature
and it's symbols.  But this is brief explanation of what I use
and what it means:

  "h"  means hammer on.

  "p" means pull off.  

  "/" or "\" means slide up or slide down, respectively.

  "^"  means bend (hey it's the best I could do).  
  Bend to the next tabbed note.

  "(x)"  means that the note in the () is not picked.  
  It is either bent too, released to, hammered onto, or 
  pulled off from.
