   <pre class="tabs">
I don't know if there are any standard ways of making tablature
and it's symbols but this is brief explanation of what I use
and what it means:

  "h" hammer on.

  "p" pull off.  

  "/" or "\" slide up or slide down, respectively.

  "^" bend to the next tabbed note.

  "(x)"  means that the note in the () is not picked.  
  It is either bent too, released to, hammered onto, or 
  pulled off from.
