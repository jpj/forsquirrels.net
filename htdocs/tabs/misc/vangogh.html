Em
Here we are, 
    F
I'm breaking up. 
C                  Am
Steal the breath before me now. 
C  BmAmD/F#G  Em            Em       G
Daylight comes to those who wait for sun. 

Am            C           D(add9)       Em
Falling down, getting up, coming round, and watch my back.
           C             G            Em 
You're the only one, who noticed me before, 
    G
Sometimes. 

Em        F
I used to be alone.
C                   Am         C Bm
Get up, get up, get up and shine.
   Am      D/F#
Oh shine, oh shine. 
G       Em            Em
Tonight, like your eyes.
G      Am      C     
Like a lover's coffee cup. 
D(add9)
Answer me, 
     Em         C
it's all I ever wanted.
    G                Em                 G 
and rejected for and tossed aside for a later day. 

Em              F
Roll over, roll over, roll over,
     C                Am 
roll over and kiss me gently.
        C       Bm      Am     D/F# 
Kiss me gently, kiss me gently. 

  G              Em     G
I hear the voices again tonight.
       G                          C 
I will sleep inside your mouth tonight.
