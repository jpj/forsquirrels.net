	  Uh oh. Tha page <i><?le _echo env=REQUEST_URI:; ?></i>
	  doesn't seem to exist. Well, it is to be expected. Nothing
	  on the internet is very perminant. And this site was heavily
	  rebuilt in June of 2006. But most of the 404's ("Page not found's")
	  are because I moved the "pics" section which is now located
	  at <a href="/pics.html">pics.html</a>.
